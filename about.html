            <p>Hi! I’m Ishant Singh Bisht, an aspiring developer with a strong foundation in programming and a passion for creating innovative solutions through technology. Currently, I am in my first year of B.Tech, where I am honing my skills in various programming languages and frameworks.</p>
            <p>Throughout my schooling, I developed a keen interest in computer science, which led me to pursue a career in development. I have worked on several projects, including a random number generator in C and a Python-based calculator with graphical user interface. These experiences have enhanced my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of software development principles.</p>
            <p>As part of my journey, I am also developing a personal website under the name "Ixotic." This site is a platform for showcasing my projects, skills, and professional experiences. It is still under development, but I aim to provide visitors with insights into my work and capabilities as I continue to grow as a developer.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my website! I look forward to connecting with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts.</p>
